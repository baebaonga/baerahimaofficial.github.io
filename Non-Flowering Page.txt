<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold;"><b>Non-flowering plants</b> are those that reproduce without producing flowers or fruits. They are also referred to as cryptogams. Algae, mushrooms, ferns, mosses, and some gymnosperms such as conifers and cycads are examples of non-flowering plants. These plants are vital to the ecosystem because they provide us with food, help build soil, and protect us from storms. They are also important vegetation in floodplains, wetlands, and estuaries, and play an important role in the wastewater recycling cycle. Non-flowering plants do not need pollination and do not rely on wind or insects to transfer pollen from one plant to another.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold;">Instead, these plants reproduce through spores, fragmentation, and rhizomes, among other means. Spores are small cells with distinct dormancy periods that make them extremely resilient. Fragmentation is the process of breaking off a piece of the plant and regrowing it, whereas rhizomes are root systems that allow the plant to spread out and form dense populations. Our ecosystems would be drastically different without non-flowering plants, and this would have a significant impact on our lives.</p>
