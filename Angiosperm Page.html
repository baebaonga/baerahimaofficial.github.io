<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold;">An angiosperm, literally meaning <b>'covered seed'</b>, is the most common type of plant found on earth today. This group of plants includes flowers, grasses, shrubs, trees and more. They are the largest group of living organisms and are estimated to make up around <b>80%</b> of all the flora on earth.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold;"><b>Angiosperms</b> have evolved over time, making them extremely resilient and diverse. As a result, they can live in a wide range of environments, from arctic tundra to tropical rainforests. They can withstand a variety of conditions, including soil fertility, temperature, and light intensity. Their success stems in large part from the evolutionary journey that has allowed them to become so diverse and successful.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold;">The way angiosperms reproduce is one of their distinguishing characteristics. Many angiosperms use flowers to attract insects, which then transfer pollen from flower to flower, fertilizing them to produce more and ensuring the species' survival. This has been refined over time and is one of the primary reasons for the angiosperm's survival.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold;">Another distinct feature of this plant group is its classification. The three main types are monocots, eudicots and gymnosperms. Monocots are characterised by thin leaves, veins that run parallel to each other and the presence of only one cotyledon in the seed. Eudicots, which include roses and ragweed, are recognisable due to the leaves having a net-like pattern of veins and two cotyledons. Gymnosperms are the least-evolved class of angiosperms and solely reproduce using tree cones, unlike the other two groups.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold;"><b>Angiosperms</b> provide numerous benefits to humans and the environment. They are a major source of food for humans, as well as a major source of oxygen, which is required for human survival. Because of their diversity, they can also be harvested for a variety of products ranging from paper and building materials to medicines.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold;">To sum up, Angiosperms play a critical role in the ecosystem and the environment. They not only provide a variety of benefits to humans, but they are also essential for a variety of plants and animals to survive on Earth so angiosperms are an essential part of the natural world, and their presence is required.</p>
